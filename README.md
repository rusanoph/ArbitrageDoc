## :dart: About ##

Our application is designed for extracting facts/entities from textual data. Application has been developed to data labeling system that forms the context of documents. Using this context, our application employs a specialized algorithm to extract the necessary entities from the text.

## Key Features: ##
* Textual Data Analysis: Our application analyzes textual data to identify and extract relevant entities.
* Data Labeling System: We have implemented a robust data labeling system that helps in the formation of document contexts.
* Entity Extraction: Using a specially designed algorithm, our application extracts the required entities from the text based on the established context.

## How It Works: ##
* Data Labeling: Users input text data into the application.
* Context Formation: The application utilizes the data labeling system to create contexts for the documents.
* Entity Extraction: Using the established contexts, the application employs the specialized algorithm to extract the desired entities from the text.

## Use Cases: ##
* Information Retrieval: Ideal for quickly retrieving specific information from large text documents.
* Entity Recognition: Facilitates the identification and extraction of entities such as names, dates, locations, and more from textual data.

**Example:**
Suppose we have a large document containing information about various events and their locations. Our application, with its entity extraction capabilities, can swiftly extract event names and their corresponding locations
